# Challenge - Tableau

## Scope
The New York Marathon is considered one of the most challenging races around the world. As it is one of the 6 major marathons in the world, it is one of the main events in the city every year.

The Tableau file shared on the link below includes different visualizations to analyse the behaviour of the New York Citi Bike usage on  the day of the New York Marathon for 2022. The dashboards and Story pretend to compare what is the difference between a normal Sunday compare to the Sunday of the NYC Marathon

The was developed on Tableau and is public on the following link:

## Results
- One of the main conclusions of the analysis is that the New York Citi Bike shows an increment of 47% on the day of the NYC Marathon. Therefore, it is needed to increase the availability of bikes and options on the day of the race to supply that demand.

- As expected, the number of casual users moved from 20% on a normal day, to 30% on the day of the race, showing the number of tourists or foreigners that use the system on the day of the race. It would be relevant to include some special deals or sales for casual members on the day of the Marathon.

- The line chart shows a similar behaviour for the race day and the next Sunday. That shows that the city keeps using the system in the same way independently of the race. Nevertheless, the frequency is double for the hours of the race (between 9 am and 3 pm)
